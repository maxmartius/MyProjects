## For Fun Projects

These are my own little free-time projects.  
Most have been created during my first two years studying.  
They are quite small and fun way to get better at programming   
and understanding new languages and frameworks.

### little Games

A short java implementation of a Tetris, Pacman and Snake Prototype

### first2DJavaApp/funnyAnimation

Playing around with shadows and animations in 2D Java

### kaggle Challenge

A quick python implementation of the Titanic kaggle Challenge (ML-Project)

### ThreejsAPP

My first try on a javascript website using Three.js

### KochKurven

A JavaFX implementation for the "KochKurven" (inspired by the object-oriented programming course)

## Bigger University-Projects

### Mp2p - Mobile peer to peer systems

In this course a fellow student and I implemented various versions of the Corona-Warn App and  the Luca App.  
Afterwards those where analysed and tested for security and privacy Risks.

### Computergraphic

In this project I implemented multiple renderers in c++.

### Chatbot

In this group project we implemented a Chatbot, that:  

1. reads in PDFs (lectures) and summarizes them using GPT4-turbo
2. saves them as embedded vectors in a pinecone-database
3. answers questions by finding fitting context from the database, and asking GPT

The Chatbot is a python/Flask application and was deployed using Kubernetes.
